# Ideas

* Midi controller (with usb output) that maps buttons to different chords. So pressing one button would send MIDI information for all notes associated with that chord. Useful for jamming on a solo instrument and just pressing buttons for chords. Maybe even add some knobs for tempo/volume/etc 
* Small omni robot platform PCB. Similar to TOFU, but on a much smaller scale. Basically just (this)[https://youtu.be/OIdMkZyhx7E], but a more extensible platform that would allow me to stack more PCBs to add more functionality, same way we did for TARS.
	* Even smaller platform that is literally just: ESP32, 3 motors (3 omni wheels, and undecided number of ultrasonic IR sensors for distance ranging). The intention beng that you could build a swarm of boids in the physical world instead of just simulating them. See [this video](https://youtu.be/bqtqltqcQhw)
* Dongle I plug into my car that has wifi/BT capabilities and talks to my iPhone, henced turning my car's wired carplay into wireless carplay 
* Simple sensor suite. To test estimation algorithms, practice writing drivers. Would have some sensors, SD card reader, microcontroller
* Simple game keychain. LCD screen, some buttons, play a simple game like pong
	* Extend this to have wireless capabilities so two people with one of these devices each could play a simple turn based game. 

* Simple game joycon. Some joysticks, buttons, knobs. To practice PCB design and driver development 
* Simple fitness tracker. Tiny PCB with IMU, haptic engine, button/dial.  I don't know how difficult heart rate monitoring is but maybe that as well
